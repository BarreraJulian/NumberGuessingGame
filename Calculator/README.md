# Calculator

Basic working calculator. Helped me learn about floats, functions, and return.

**The Calculator works as the following**
  -  Enter 'a' to add
  -  Enter 's' to subtract
  -  Enter 'm' to multiply
  -  Enter 'd' to divide
  -  Enter 'q' to quit

**Coming Soon!** <br>
I hope to cotinue to add onto this and add things to further learn more things in Python.
