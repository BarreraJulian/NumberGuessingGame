# NumberGuessingGame
This game is my first project using Python.

**The game works as the following:**
  - Pick a number between 1 - 10
  - You have 3 guesses to pick the correct number.
  - If you can't pick the number in those 3 guesses the game is over.

**Coming Soon!**
  - Currently working on adding different difficulty's
  - **COMPLETED** âœ… Currently working on adding the "play again" if you miss all 3 guesses.
