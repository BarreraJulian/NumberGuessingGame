# NumberGuessingGame
This game was created using Python. This is my first project using Python.

The game works as the following:
Pick a number between 1 - 10
You have 3 guesses to pick the correct number.

Features:
  - Currently working on adding different difficulty's
  - Currently working on adding the "play again" if you miss all 3 guesses.
  - Once you get the answer correct you are able to play again.
